Next.js has become one of the most popular React frameworks for building modern web applications. When combined with TypeScript, it provides an excellent developer experience with type safety and powerful tooling.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js offers several advantages:

- **Server-side rendering** out of the box
- **Static site generation** for better performance
- **API routes** for full-stack development
- **Automatic code splitting** for optimized bundles

## Setting Up TypeScript

Adding TypeScript to your Next.js project is straightforward:

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/node
```

Next.js will automatically detect TypeScript files and configure everything for you.

## Best Practices

1. Use proper TypeScript interfaces for your data
2. Leverage Next.js built-in optimizations
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Use static generation when possible

This combination provides a robust foundation for building scalable web applications.
