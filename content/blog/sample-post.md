# Getting Started with Next.js and TypeScript

Next.js has become one of the most popular React frameworks for building modern web applications. When combined with TypeScript, it provides an excellent developer experience with type safety and powerful tooling.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js offers several advantages:

- **Server-side rendering** out of the box
- **Static site generation** for better performance
- **API routes** for full-stack development
- **Automatic code splitting** for optimized bundles

## Setting Up TypeScript

Adding TypeScript to your Next.js project is straightforward:

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/node
```

Next.js will automatically detect TypeScript files and configure everything for you.

## Best Practices

1. Use proper TypeScript interfaces for your data
2. Leverage Next.js built-in optimizations
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Use static generation when possible

This combination provides a robust foundation for building scalable web applications.
